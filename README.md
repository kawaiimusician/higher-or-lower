# Higher or Lower?
This is a simple higher or lower card game I created using what I learned from the [Magic Memory](https://github.com/kawaiimusician/magic-memory) app I created. 

During this project I attempted to utilize the github branches however since it was a relatively small one page project, there wasn't much to put into branches. I did get some practice with merging branches though which was helpful. 

I also learned through this project that I personally need to work on planning my code more because there were multiple things that I started doing, such as created an onClick event for the 2nd card, that was completely unnecessary. It was good practice but having a more concrete plan would be super helpful.
